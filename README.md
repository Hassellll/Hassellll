<h3 align="center">A passionate Python and Ml developer from Guatemala</h3>

I am a very curious and disciplined high school senior from Guatemala who loves learning new things and coding increasingly complex things. I learned Python at the age of 15 and set my sights on new horizons, such as taking ML courses and creating prediction and classification models. I am completely passionate about technology and especially AI. I would like to master each of its branches and create visionary projects such as computer vision models that help humans in different areas of industry, as well as create holograms with AI. It sounds ambitious, but humans have achieved so many “impossible” feats that have proven to us that being a visionary is being a madman who still creates wonders. 



  I’m currently working on my **Full ML Course**

  I’m currently learning **Computer vision and circuits with arduino**
